# Day 12

Modern Python today, with type annotations, dataclasses, generators and [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) unit tests. The first part was pretty straightforward, just make an infinite generator that yield each moon state then count to the desired states.

I was a bit short of time on the day so I had to leave part 2 and come back to it at the weekend. In the meantime I had the intuition of finding the loop for each axis, then multiplying those together and cancelling any common factors.
