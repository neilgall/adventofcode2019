# Day 20

Let's switch it up and do this one in Rust! I did a little Rust [earlier this year](https://github.com/neilgall/pirrigator/) but a recursive Dijkstra / flood fill style algorithm seems like a new challenge in a language that takes memory safety seriously. My implementation is perhaps not that efficient but it runs quick enough for part 1.

* `cargo test` to run the test case
* `cargo run` to run against the real input
