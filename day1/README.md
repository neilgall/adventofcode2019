# Day 1

I rebuilt my laptop just a few days ago so here was a good chance to get all the Haskell tooling reinstalled. With hspec installed it will run with a Ctrl-B in Sublime Text with the Haskell Build System selected.

## Part 1

Straightforward enough - just do the calculation and sum the results.

## Part 2

This was trickier, not least because one of the key requirements was an extra statement in parenthesis at the end of the spec. But that's how requirements often arrive - building correct software is as much about these soft skills as the hard technical stuff.assert(

## Further Fun

I reimplemented my Day 1 solutions in Python and Julia. I've never written any Julia before so this was interesting. Feels a bit like Python with static types at this stage. I like the built-in unit testing.

Both will run in Sublime Text with the appropriate packages installed and build system selected. Or use a command line.
