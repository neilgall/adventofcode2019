# Day 13

Part 1 is a straightforward conversion of Day 11's painting robot. Same technique.

For part 2 I experimented with making the game playable using non-blocking TTY I/O but I couldn't knock out more than two or three blocks. A simple input logic to make the paddle track the ball's x coordinate worked first time.
